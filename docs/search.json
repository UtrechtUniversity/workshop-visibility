    "text": "3.3 Update the template\nIn the index.Rmd file, update your name or website title and include a file path to your photo (which should preferably be in the same folder as `index.Rmd).\nYou can also update the URLs. If you would like to use icons for your URLs, you have the following options:\n\n3.3.1 Fontawesome Icons\nFontawesome icons can be embedded using the fontawesome package we installed earlier. It can be used for URLs related to email addresses, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub. Other icons are available as well, you might want to explore the possibilities by referring to the fontawesome package’s GitHub page\nNote how you would have to adapt the label field of your template below and adapt it accordingly.\n\n  - label: '`r fontawesome::fa(name = \"envelope\", height = \"30px\")`'\n    url: \"mailto:n.moopen@uu.nl\"\n  - label: '`r fontawesome::fa(name = \"github\", height = \"30px\")`'\n    url: \"https://github.com/nehamoopen\"  \n  - label: '`r fontawesome::fa(name = \"twitter\", height = \"30px\")`'\n    url: \"https://twitter.com/NehaMoopen\"\n  - label: '`r fontawesome::fa(name = \"linkedin\", height = \"30px\")`'\n    url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-moopen/\"\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Academicons\nAcademicons can also be embedded like Fontawesome icons, but it looks a bit different. This is relevant for icons related to Orcid, Google Scholar, a generic CV and possibly many others. Once again, note how the label needs to be adjusted and adapt it accordingly.\n\n  - label: <i class=\"ai ai-orcid ai-2x\"></i>\n    url: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1412-4402\" \n  - label: <i class=\"ai ai-google-scholar ai-2x\"></i>\n    url: \"https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=q_cH9ZgAAAAJ&hl=en\"\n  - label: <i class=\"ai ai-cv ai-2x\"></i>\n    url: \"https://nehamoopen.github.io/CV/\"\n\nLastly, to get Academicons to work, you need to include one line of code immediately after the --- in your index.Rmd file. In other words, right after the end of your YAML header/metadata area and right before any text in the body of your document.\n\n<!--Academicons Icons-->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpswalsh/academicons@1/css/academicons.min.css\">\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Write\nWrite a couple of lines as part of your bio."
