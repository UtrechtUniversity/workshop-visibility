For this workshop you need the following:

1. R, which can be downloaded from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) website.

2. RStudio, which can be downloaded from the [posit.co](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) website. 

3. Quarto, which can be downloaded from the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) website.

4. The `postcards` and `fontawesome` R packages. 

For this, you can open RStudio and paste the following lines of code in the _Console_ and press enter.

install.packages("postcards")
```

```{r}

install.packages("fontawesome")
```

5. An account on [GitHub](www.github.com).

Finally, it would be good if you had a photo of yourself that you could use for your personal website.
